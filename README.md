A simple command-line Pomodoro timer written for personal use.

The script has only been tested on macOS and may not work on Linux systems due to its reliance on `afplay` for audio alerts.

### Features
- Customizable work/break durations
- Visual countdown
- Sound notification when session ends
- Easy to install & use

### Installation
1. Clone repository
2. Make script executable
3. You can make the script global to call it from anywhere (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3560326/how-to-make-a-shell-script-global)
